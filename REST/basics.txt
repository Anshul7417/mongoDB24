api allows two apps to communicate with each other.

rest api----Representational state transfer.it is an architectural style for api that uses http requests to acces and use data.

simple bhasha m http request bdlenge aur kaam hojayega url change nhi krna hai.

four http methods----

get  ------>          read
post ------>          create
put / patch         ---->   update  (put m pura change patch m srf jitna krna h.........tv remote example)
delete --------> delete



rest is stateless mtlb hr request isolation m hoga....ussey koi mtlb nhi h ki phle kya kiya tha ya baad m kya kroge.
